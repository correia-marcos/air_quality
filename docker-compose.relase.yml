      - ./data/raw:/air_monitoring/data/raw:ro  # Read-only for safety
      
      # 2. OUTPUT: Mount results so the user can see what was produced
      - ./results:/air_monitoring/results
      
      # 3. NO CODE MOUNTS:
      # We intentionally DO NOT mount ./src or ./scripts. 
      # The container must use the code 'baked' into it during the build.
      
      # 4. NO CACHE/CREDENTIAL MOUNTS:
      # No .Renviron, no .netrc, no renv_cache. 
      # The image must contain all necessary libraries.
